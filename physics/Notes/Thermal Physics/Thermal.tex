    \LARGE Atoms \\
    \large Atoms consist of electrons and protons. The electrons are negatively charged and the protons are positively charged. The size of one atom is around 0.1nm or \num{0.1e-9} meters known as one Ångström. \\
    \large A neutral atom has an equal number of protons and electrons, referred to as its atomic number, When an atom loses or gains an electron itt becomes an ion. When noting isotopes we use \ce{^{A}_{Z}X+} where Z in the proton number, A is the nucleon number and X is the chemical symbol. \\ 
    \large The number of neutrons can be found with \{N = A - Z\}.
