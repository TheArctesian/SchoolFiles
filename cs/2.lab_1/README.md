# Vending Machine

Students at CIS have been clamoring for more coffee options. They feel that the extra shot of caffeine will help them get over the hump during that mid-day slump. They've requested you to create the software for a vending machine. 


Success Criteria: 


Vending Machine should be filled with up to 10 cans of each time of coffee:

- 10 Espressos
- 10 Capuccinos
- 10 Lattes


A student should be able to do the following:

- Order a dose of java by typing "espresso", "capuccino" or "latte".

- Each student should have a set amount of money

- Each student starts with $50 in their account

- There is no limit on amount of student accounts. 

- If a type of coffee has run out, the program should display "this type of java has run out" or some other helpful message.

- If a student runs out of money, the program should display "you don't have enough funds" or some other helpful message.

- When the user types "reload", all of the coffees should be filled so that there are 10 cans of each type again. 

Obvious things that might not be so obvious:

- If a student spends (for example) $5, their account should be updated accordingly

- You can choose the cost for each item

- There should never be negative amounts of items in the machine

- A student should not have negative amount of money
